The gram package
================

This documentation describes gram version 3.1, from May 2016.

Source code is at `https://github.com/pgfoster/gram <https://github.com/pgfoster/gram>`_

The gram Python package exists to aid making vector graphics programmatically.
Output might include TikZ and the resulting PDF, or the output may be SVG.  It
was originally made for drawing phylogenetic trees, which are sufficiently
stylized that it makes sense to draw them with a program or script.  Here is an
SVG of a couple of phylogenetic trees.
